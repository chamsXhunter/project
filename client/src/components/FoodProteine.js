    <p>Dairy products, or dairy products, are milk or food processing products obtained from milk. When processed, the milk used is mostly cow's milk, but raw milk from goats, sheep, camels, yaks, and buffaloes is also used. Their introduction into the human diet, generally after weaning, dates back to the Neolithic Revolution[1].

Dairy products are not necessarily produced from raw milk, but can also be produced from pasteurized, sterilized, UHT milk, etc.</p>

    <p>Fish is a significant source of high-quality protein, with edible parts typically containing 15-20% protein. This protein is composed of various types, including structural proteins (like actin and myosin), sarcoplasmic proteins (like albumins), and connective tissue proteins (like collagen). The specific protein content can vary based on factors like species, age, and environmental conditions. </p>

    <p>Meat is a significant source of protein, considered a complete protein because it contains all essential amino acids. For example, a 4-ounce serving of steak, chicken breast, or pork chop contains about 30 grams of protein. Meat also provides other nutrients like fat, vitamins (including B12), and minerals (like zinc and iron).   </p>
